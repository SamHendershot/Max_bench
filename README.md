# Max bench

Uses a neural network to determine someone's maximum bench press weight according to factors such as: age, weight, sex, and equipment used. This model does assume the user making the prediction to have some weightlifting experience under his/her belt. This was a fascinating project for me since I enjoy weightlifting and maintaining health. I have tested the model with some of my friends that go to the gym and it correctly predicted their bench press maximums for 3/4 of them.
